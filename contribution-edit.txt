# I would like to make a small contribution or to start with TensorFlow as ML and OpenCV is something that I am totally interested in when it comes to ML/AI. """ 

I would like to make the Tensorflow avalalble for the i686 / 32bit architecture of Linux Ubuntu 18.05.04 build 
Made this file additionally just to have no controversy or what not, I just forked the project from the @clear-m, my colleague at the NXLog and I hope it's fine to,do it.

For now only this.
